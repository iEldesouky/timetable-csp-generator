# ðŸŽ“ Automated Timetable Generator using Constraint Satisfaction Problems

An Intelligent Systems project that formulates university timetable generation as a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** and solves it using advanced backtracking algorithms with optimization techniques.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This system automatically generates optimal university timetables by modeling the scheduling problem as a CSP, where:
- **Variables** represent course sections needing scheduling
- **Domains** consist of all possible (time, room, instructor) combinations  
- **Constraints** enforce scheduling rules and preferences

The solver employs **AI search strategies** including Minimum Remaining Values (MRV), Least Constraining Value (LCV), and forward checking to efficiently find feasible schedules.

## ðŸš€ Features
